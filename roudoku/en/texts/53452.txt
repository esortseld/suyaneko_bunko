The blue button. 
By Ogawa Mimei

This is a story from elementary-school days.
One day, a girl none of them knew came into the class Masao was in.

Everyone, the teacher said.
Starting today this young lady will be one of your classmates, so please be kind to her.

When someone they did not know walked in, it made everyone feel that something was out of the ordinary. Nor was it only Masao. Seeing someone from another country, they hesitated for a moment, yet at the same time already wanted to be friends and talk to her.

So much so that the very thought that she was someone from another country - someone from a far-off land they did not know - stirred in them a kind of longing.
For the first two or three days, no one in particular tried to be friendly with the girl, but no one spoke ill of her, either.
