The blue button. 
By Ogawa Mimei

This is a story from elementary-school days.
One day, a girl none of them knew came into the class Masao was in.
“Everyone,” the teacher said, “starting today this young lady will be one of your classmates, so please be kind to her.”

When someone they didn’t know walked in, it made everyone feel that something was out of the ordinary. Nor was it only Masao. Seeing someone from another country, they hesitated for a moment, yet at the same time already wanted to be friends and talk to her.
